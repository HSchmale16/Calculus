\title{Applying Ahmdahl's Law to the Mandelbrot Fractal}

% Write the abstract
\begin{abstract}
The mandelbrot fractal is an incredibly time consuming calculation.
The drawing of the mandelbrot fractal can be speed up by multithreading.
However, there is a finate amount of performance that can be gained by
this method. The law governing this performance gain is called Amdahl's
Law.
\end{abstract}

\section{The Mandelbrot Set}

\section{Amdahl's Law}
Ahmdahl's Law is used to find the maximum expected improvement to an overall
system when only one part of the system is improved. This law is most often
used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum speedup when
using many processors to operate on a workload in parallel. This law is named
after the computer architect Gene Amdahl.

The speedup of a program using many processors in parallel is limited by the
amount of time needed for the serial fraction of the program. That is the
section that must be executed in a single thread of execution, or the part
that cannot be parallelized.

\subsection{Equations}
Given:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $n \epsilon N$ The number of threads of execution.
  \item $B \epsilon [0,1]$ The fraction of the algorithim that is
      strictly serial.
\end{itemize}

$T(n)$ describes how long an algorithim will take to complete when running
with $n$ threads of execution, see equation \eqref{eq:amdahl_time}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:amdahl_time}
    T(n) = T(1)(B + \frac{1}{n}(1-B))
\end{equation}

Therefore, the theoretical speedup $S(n)$ that can be had on a given algorithim
on a system capable of executing $n$ threads of execution is seen in equation
\eqref{eq:amdahl_speedup}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:amdahl_speedup}
    S(n) = \frac{T(1)}{T(n)} = 
        \frac{T(1)}{T(1)(B+\frac{1}{n}(1-B))} =
        \frac{1}{B+\frac{1}{n}(1-B)}
\end{equation}
