\begin{abstract}
The mandelbrot fractal is an incredibly time consuming calculation.
The drawing of the mandelbrot fractal can be speed up by multithreading.
However, there is a finate amount of performance that can be gained by
this method. The law governing this performance gain is called Amdahl's
Law.
