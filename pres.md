# What is the Mandelbrot set?
* A set of complex numbers for which a repeating pattern does **NOT**
approach infinity.
* It is described by $z_{n+1} = z_{n}^2+c$ remains bounded.
* That means that $c$ is a member of the mandelbrot set

# Rules for drawing the Mandelbrot Fractal
* Number of Iterations for the series to converge determines color
* Some cases may require millions of iterations, so a cut-off point is
  determined.

# Applications
* Demo of simple rules creating complex thing
* Computer Benchmark
* A test of parallelization

# A demonstration
A demonstration of my implementation of the mandelbrot
fractal zoom in.
